# Seven Segment Display
# Purpose:

Drives a 7-segment display to show digits from 0 to 9.
# Functionality:

Takes a 4-bit binary-coded decimal (BCD) input (bcd).
Decodes the BCD input to determine the corresponding 7-segment display pattern.
Drives the 7-segment display segments according to the decoded pattern.
# Code Breakdown:

Module Declaration:
Defines the module name seven_segment_display.
Specifies the input port:
bcd[3:0]: 4-bit BCD input.
Specifies the output port:
display[6:0]: 7-bit output to control the 7-segment display segments.
Always Block:
Executes whenever the bcd input changes.
Implements the BCD-to-7-segment decoder using a case statement:
For each possible BCD value (0 to 9), assigns the corresponding 7-segment display pattern to the display output.
The default case handles invalid BCD values (10 to 15) by turning off all segments.
# Key Points:

The code effectively decodes BCD inputs to drive a 7-segment display.
The case statement provides a concise and efficient way to map BCD values to display patterns.
The default case handles invalid inputs gracefully by turning off the display.
The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear variable names and comments.
# Additional Considerations:

The code can be extended to handle more complex display configurations, such as displays with decimal points or multiple digits.
For larger displays, the decoder logic might become more complex.
Other decoding methods, such as using lookup tables or combinatorial logic, could be used for different applications.
